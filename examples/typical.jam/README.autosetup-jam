----------------------------

This is a port of the 'typical' example from autosetup. Static and shared
library builds are supported, as are out-of-tree ones. Installation (TODO)
and automatic reconfiguration are not supported. Note that auto.def is only
modified to generate Jam files instead of Makefiles.

Run:

  autosetup --install
  mkdir autosetup/jam
  cp <autosetup-jam>/lib/* autosetup/jam
  ./configure --init=jam
  ./configure
  jam
